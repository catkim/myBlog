Had a wonderful Thanksgiving with good friends. It's the first time I've entertained and made a big meal in my new house. Have a tiny kitchen, did a lot of clean as you go and it turned out well, turkey was moist and delicious, everyone was happy.

Didn't do any Black Friday sales, took it easy and got caught up on somethings around the house. Today I'm working on this blog. Finally got the repo up and the Git hosting set up. Now that the bare bones of this blog are up hope I can play around with it more, static sites are cool!
