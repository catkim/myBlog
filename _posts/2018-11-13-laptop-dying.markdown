I think the my HP laptop may be reaching the end of it's lifespan. Had all kinds of issues, no sound, couldn't open applications, extended monitor not working. Went over to the Apple store after work and looked a the pro books. They are really nice but expensive. Not to mention all the accessories and adapters, it's a serious investment. When I got home I worked on the HP and got it working again. Hope I can get another year out it!
