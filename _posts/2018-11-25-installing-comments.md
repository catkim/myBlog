Happy Sunday, looking to install comments for my blog later today.

Went to mass today with my beautiful daughter and wonderful friends. Had a delicious brunch at [Barrel and Ashes](https://barrelandashes.com/) in Studio City. Then on to hang out with my friend Mark. He's doing some incredible work with AWS, S3 bucket, using the browser API with audio for a Latin lesson application he's creating. Got to show him what I've been doing with Jekyll so it was a good geek out session.

Later in the day I watched as my daughter practiced her gymnastics in the yard. So proud of her she has really come a long way this year. We also took turns brushing our little dog Maggie, before the sun started to set.

Before night fall did a little yard work, got the groceries for the week, took the trash cans out, paid the mid month bills. Now I'm hoping to settle in and get the Just Comments installed.
